making a calculator in python
In this file I made a calculator in python that can add, multiply, divide and subtract.
It has 4 defined functions then runs an operation that prompts the user to enter values
in the terminal then prints the results based on what type of operation was chosen. It 
computes based off of the users input and decides which operation to use through the use 
of if statements including one for when the user inputs an invalid operation

Then I added a GUI to the calculator using tkinter and made the buttons change colors when hovered over and clicked.
